### UBC STAT 545B - Assignment B3
##### Author: Joel Campbell

#### Description

This github repository is for STAT 545B assignment b3.

This assignment consists of the creation of a shiny app that provides a quick and convenient method for the exploration of a UBC curated fungi dataset. This includes the ability to filter and sort the data, and a auto-updating count of the total number of results based on the filters chosen.

The shiny app can be found at the following link: https://joelkcamp.shinyapps.io/UBCFungi/


#### Data

The data used for this assignment was downloaded from the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria (https://www.pnwherbaria.org). The exact data set is loaded into the shiny app through a helper function using the following link: https://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/getdataset.php?File=UBC_Fungi_Native.zip
